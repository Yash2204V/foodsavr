# Food Sustainability & Recovery System

- Note: Rebuilt my own FoodSavR, earlier My Team had participated in the Vihaan007 DTU hackathon [GitHub](https://github.com/Yash2204V/Food-Waste-Reduction-System) in which the project my team showed was not good in terms of maintainability & file structure. So, Now I re-built that project to showcase my current tech stack.

## Introduction
The **Food Waste Reduction System** is designed to address food waste by connecting restaurants, grocery stores, and consumers with surplus food. This system facilitates the redistribution of excess food to those in need, reducing environmental impact and promoting food security.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: EJS, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Use Cases

### Stakeholders
- **Restaurants and Grocery Stores**: Businesses aiming to minimize food waste by redistributing surplus food to the community, thus contributing to local welfare.
- **Consumers**: Individuals seeking affordable and environmentally friendly food options while supporting local businesses and reducing waste.
- **Food Banks and Charities**: Organizations dedicated to alleviating hunger and food insecurity by distributing surplus food to those in need.

### Needy Access
A user-friendly platform allowing easy access for those in need to request available food donations, with a focus on accessibility and transparency.

## Features
1. **Donator and Receiver Database**: A streamlined database where donations are visible in the user module.
2. **Tracking System**: Automatically monitors expiration dates and removes expired items.
3. **Independent Modules**: Chatbot and tracking systems are both functional independently, with integration currently in progress.
